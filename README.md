# repo\_sorter

A powerful yet simple CLI tool that automatically organizes and cleans repositories by grouping files into intuitive folders based on their extension.

## üì¶ Installation

**Install from npm:**

```bash
npm install -g repo_sorter
```

**Or, install from GitHub for development:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Keegs-Baldwin/repo_sorter.git
cd repo_sorter
sudo npm link
```

After installing, you can run the tool using:

## üöÄ Usage

```bash

  If omitted, defaults to the current working directory.

### ‚úÖ Options

* `-h`, `--help`, `help`
  Display usage instructions.

* `--dry-run`
  Show what actions *would* be taken without actually moving or deleting anything.

### üîç Examples

* **Organize the current directory**

  ```bash
  repo-sorter
  ```

* **Organize a specific directory**

  ```bash
  repo-sorter ~/projects/my-repo
  ```

* **Dry run (preview only)**

  repo-sorter ~/projects/my-repo --dry-run
  ```

## üßº How It Works

1. **Scan** the provided directory (recursively), skipping hidden files/folders.
2. **Categorize** each file based on its extension.
3. **Move** files into subfolders under the target root (creating folders if necessary).
4. **Remove** any now-empty directories.
